      <p>my favourite character from ramayana is lord rama. lord rama was the eldest son of king dasharatha.rama was the prince of ayodhya we can learn variuse things from lord rama. some things i learnt from lord rama:</p>
      <ul>
    <div class="paralax1  ">      <li >lord rama never questioned his parents nor adults. for example when he learnt that he had to go to the forest and live their fo 14 years . he also dint mind going to the forest with sage vishwamitra and killing the demons.</li> </div>
    <div class="paralax2  ">  <li>lord rama's actions also teaches us to never give up no matter in whatever situation we are in. for instance lord rama never gave up trying to find sita</li></div>
    <div class="paralax3">      <li>lord rama never told a lie in his entire life no matter the situation he was in.</li></div>
    <div class="paralax4">      <li>lord rama was satisfied with whatever he had. he never complained and was happy with what he had.</li></div>
    <div class="paralax5"> <li>lord rama never showed off nor did he brag about his strenght </li></div>
    <div class="paralax6">    <li>lord rama was kind person who wished for the well being of all. for instance when lord indra asked him what he wanted lord rama asked than all the monkeys who laid their live for them to be alive and that the trees was filled with fruits for them</li></div>
    <div class="paralax7">       <li>lord rama sacrifised his wife so that the people of his kingdom would be happy </li> </div>
    <div class="paralax8">          <li>lord rama considered his family as the most important he wished than there was no harm on his evil spet mother Kaikeyi even though she wished that he went to the forest for 14 years</li></div>
      </ul>
  
      <div class="parallax">     <p> i will conclude by saying that we can learn to be obeident, satisfied with what we have ,never tell lies, put others before us and to remember that family is very important from lord rama.</p></div>
